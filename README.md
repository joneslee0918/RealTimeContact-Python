# RYO

Dope Wars game engine on StarkNet L2 roll-up.

## What

TI-83 drug wars built as smart contract system.

Background mechanism design notion [here](https://dope-wars.notion.site/dope-22fe2860c3e64b1687db9ba2d70b0bb5).

Initial exploration / walkthrough viability testing blog [here](https://perama-v.github.io/cairo/game/world).

Join in and learn about:

    - Cairo. A turing-complete language for programs that become proofs.
    - StarkNet. An Ethereum L2 rollup with:
        - L1 for data availability
        - State transitions executed by validity proofs that the EVM checks.

## Setup

Clone this repo and use our docker shell to interact with starknet:

```
git clone git@github.com:dopedao/RYO.git
cd RYO
bin/shell starknet --version
```

The CLI allows you to deploy to StarkNet and read/write to contracts
already deployed. The CLI communicates with a server that StarkNet
runs, which bundles the requests, executes the program (contracts are
Cairo programs), creates and aggregates validity proofs, then posts them
to the Goerli Ethereum testnet. Learn more in the Cairo language and StarkNet
docs [here](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/), which also has instructions for manual
installation if you are not using docker.

If using VS-code for writing code, install the extension for syntax highlighting:

```
curl -LO https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases/download/v0.4.0/cairo-0.4.0.vsix
code --install-extension cairo-0.4.0.vsix
code .
```

## Dev

Flow:

1. Compile the contract with the CLI
2. Test using pytest
3. Deploy with CLI
4. Interact using the CLI or the explorer

File name prefixes are paired (e.g., contract, ABI and test all share comon prefix).

### Compile

The compiler will check the integrity of the code locally.
It will also produce an ABI, which is a mapping of the contract functions
(used to interact with the contract).
```
bin/shell starknet-compile contracts/GameEngineV1.cairo \
    --output contracts/GameEngineV1_compiled.json \
    --abi abi/GameEngineV1_contract_abi.json

bin/shell starknet-compile contracts/MarketMaker.cairo \
    --output contracts/MarketMaker_compiled.json \
    --abi abi/MarketMaker_contract_abi.json
```

### Test

```
bin/shell pytest testing/GameEngineV1_contract_test.py

bin/shell pytest testing/MarketMaker_contract_test.py
```

### Deploy

```
bin/shell starknet deploy --contract contracts/GameEngineV1_compiled.json \
    --network=alpha

bin/shell starknet deploy --contract contracts/MarketMaker_compiled.json \
    --network=alpha
```

Upon deployment, the CLI will return an address, which can be used
to interact with.

Check deployment status by passing in the transaction ID you receive:
```
bin/shell starknet tx_status --network=alpha --id=151281
```
`PENDING` Means that the transaction passed the validation and is waiting to be sent on-chain.
```
{
    "block_id": 16065,
    "tx_status": "ACCEPTED_ONCHAIN"
}
```
### Interact

CLI - Write (initialise markets). Set up `item_id=5` across all 40 locations,
with locations 1, 11, 21, etc. 2, 12, 22 etc. having identical curves. Each pair has 10x more money than item quantity.
```
bin/shell starknet invoke \
    --network=alpha \
    --address 0x0605ecb2519a1953425824356435b04364bebd3513e1c34fcb4c75ded01e6b29 \
    --abi abi/GameEngineV1_contract_abi.json \
    --function admin_set_pairs_for_item \
    --inputs 5 \
        40 \
        10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 \
        10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 \
        10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 \
        10 20 30 42 50 60 70 80 90 100 \
        40 \
        100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 \
        100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 \
        100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 \
        100 200 300 444 500 600 700 800 900 1000
```
Change `5` to another `item_id` in the range `1-10` to populate other curves.

CLI - Write (initialize user). Set up `user_id=733` to have `200` of item `5`.
```
bin/shell starknet invoke \
    --network=alpha \
    --address 0x0605ecb2519a1953425824356435b04364bebd3513e1c34fcb4c75ded01e6b29 \
    --abi abi/GameEngineV1_contract_abi.json \
    --function admin_set_user_amount \
    --inputs 733 5 200
```
CLI - Read (user state)
```
bin/shell starknet call \
    --network=alpha \
    --address 0x0605ecb2519a1953425824356435b04364bebd3513e1c34fcb4c75ded01e6b29 \
    --abi abi/GameEngineV1_contract_abi.json \
    --function check_user_state \
    --inputs 733
```
CLI - Write (Have a turn). User `733` goes to location `34` to sell (sell is `1`,
buy is `0`) item `5`, giving `100` units.
```
bin/shell starknet invoke \
    --network=alpha \
    --address 0x0605ecb2519a1953425824356435b04364bebd3513e1c34fcb4c75ded01e6b29 \
    --abi abi/GameEngineV1_contract_abi.json \
    --function have_turn \
    --inputs 733 34 1 5 100
```
Calling the `check_user_state()` function again reveals that the `100` units were
exchanged for `333` money.

Alternatively, see and do all of the above with the Voyager browser [here](https://voyager.online/contract/0x0605ecb2519a1953425824356435b04364bebd3513e1c34fcb4c75ded01e6b29#writeContract).

## Game flow

```
admin ->
        initialise state variables
        lock admin power
user_1 ->
        have_turn(got_to_loc, trade_x_for_y)
            check if game finished.
            check user authentification.
            check if user allowed using game clock.
            add to random seed.
            user location update.
                decrease money count if new city.
            check for dealer dash (x %).
                check for chase dealer (x %).
            trade with market curve for location.
            check for any of:
                mugging (x %).
                    check for run (x %).
                gang bust (x %).
                    check for fight (x %).
                cop raid (x %).
                    check for bribe (x %).
                find item (x %).
                local shipment (x %).
                    update items count in suburb curve.
            save next allowed turn as game_clock + n.
user2 -> (same as user_1)
```

## Next steps

Building out parts to make a functional `v1`. Some good entry-level options
for anyone wanting to try out Cairo.

- Initialised multiple player states.
- Connect random engine to turn to trigger probabalistic theft.
- Turn rate limiting. Game has global clock that increments every time
    a turn occurs. User has a lockout of x clock ticks.
- Game end criterion based on global clock.
- Finish `mappings/locations.json`. Name places and implement different cost to travel for
some locations.
    - Locations will e.g., be 10 cities each with 4 suburbs.
    - E.g., locations 1-10 are suburb 1. Locations 2, 12, 22, 32 are
    city 2. So `location_id=27` is city 7, suburb 3. Free to travel to
    other suburbs in same city (7, 17, 37).
    - Need to create a file with nice city/subrub names for these in
- Finish `mappings/items.json`. Populate and tweak the item names and item unit price.
E.g., cocaine price per unit different from weed price per unit.
- Finish `mappings/initial_markets.csv`. Create lists of market pair values to initialize the
game with. E.g., for all 40 locations x 10 items = 400 money_count-item_count pairs as a
separate file. A mapping of 600 units with 6000 money initialises
a dealer in that location with 60 of the item at (6000/60) 100 money per item. This mapping should
be in the ballpark of the value in `items.json`. The fact that values deviate, creates trade
opportunities at the start of the game. (e.g., a location might have large quantity at lower price).
- Finish `mappings/probabilities.json`. How likely is it that a player will trigger an event?
This is a chance out of 1000, with `1` corresponding to 0.1% chance (avoid decimals in Cairo).
- Initialize users with money upon first turn. (e.g., On first turn triggers save
of starting amount e.g., 10,000, then sets the flag to )
- Create caps on maximum parameters (40 location_ids, 10k user_ids, 10 item_ids)
- User authentication. E.g., signature verification.
- Add health clock. E.g., some events lower health
