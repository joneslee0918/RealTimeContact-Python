## Getting Setup

<details><summary>Initial Setup</summary>

<p>

Clone this repo and use our docker shell to interact with hardhat:

```
git clone git@github.com:BibliothecaForAdventurers/realms-contracts.git
cd realms-contracts
npm install
npm compile
```

</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Development Workflow</summary>

If you are using VSCode, we provide a development container with all required dependencies.
When opening VS Code, it should ask you to re-open the project in a container, if it finds
the .devcontainer folder. If not, you can open the Command Palette (`cmd + shift + p`),
and run ‚ÄúRemote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container‚Äù.

## Outline

Flow:

1. Compile the contract with the CLI
2. Test using `npm run test`
3. Deploy with CLI
4. Interact using the CLI or the explorer

### Compile

The compiler will check the integrity of the code locally.
It will also produce an ABI, which is a mapping of the contract functions
(used to interact with the contract).

Compile all contracts:

```
npm run compile
```

### Test

- TODO: Add test instructions here

### Deploy

2. **Fork the repo** so you can make and test changes in your local repository.
3. **Test your changes** Follow the procedures for testing in each contract sub-directory (e.g. [/contracts/settling_game](./contracts/settling_game/) and make sure your tests (manual and/or automated) pass.
4. **Create a pull request** and describe the changes you made. Include a reference to the Issue you created.
5. **Monitor and respond to comments** made by the team around code standards and suggestions. Most pull requests will have some back and forth.
